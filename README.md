# Unrolled Primal Dual Spliting for Optical Flow Estimation

## TODO
- write dataloader for flying things, middleburry
- unroll TVL1\_VCA
- allow different supervised loss functions (deep supervision, gradient stopping, etc.)
- train networks
	- experiment with scales, warping per scale, and loss functions
- write image-driven total generalized variation L1 optical flow
