# Unrolled Primal Dual Spliting for Optical Flow Estimation

## TODO
- code error/loss functions (endpoint error, etc.)
- write dataloader for sintel, kitti, flying things, middleburry
- unroll TVL1\_BCA and TVL1\_VCA
- allow different supervised loss functions (deep supervision, gradient stopping, etc.)
- train networks
	- experiment with scales, warping per scale, and loss functions
	- seperable filters used in opposite directions for v\_x, v\_y?
- code ITGV-L1
